# Fly Like a Bird Test
Fly Like a Bird Test will be a Minetest mod based on a game called [Fly Like a bird 3](https://rw-developement.itch.io/flab3-classic).

This will be the first time I've ever programmed something, *if* I don't blow it off and not write any code at all.

### Flylikeabirdtest goals:

- [ ] You can be a human or a bird. Birds can poo on humans or other birds. You have a poo o meter.
- [ ] Later, implement more bird types.
- [ ] I learn how to program while doing this project.

### TODO:

- [ ] Find out how Minetest's glider, or other flying vehicle mods, works.
- [ ] Cargo cult the code into turning the player into a bird?
- [ ] Create bird models
- [ ] Decide whether this mod is going to be a mod or a game.
- [ ] Implement pooing. Make it hurt birds and non-birds or something.
- [ ] Implement poo meter and chips.
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
